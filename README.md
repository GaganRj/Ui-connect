Full-Page Responsive Component Documentation

Project Overview:
This project involves creating a full-page, full-width, and full-height component using React. The component displays an image that adapts to different screen sizes, a translucent overlay, a centered title, and a button that triggers an alert when clicked. The implementation avoids using any CSS or JS frameworks and demonstrates advanced frontend development skills.

Key Features:
1. Responsive Image Loading: The component loads different images based on the screen size to optimize performance.
2. Full-Screen Layout: The component covers the entire viewport, ensuring a consistent look across all devices.
3. Translucent Overlay: An overlay is added to enhance text readability against the background image.
4. Centered Title and Button: The title and button are centered on the screen, providing a balanced and aesthetically pleasing layout.
5. Button Alert: A button click triggers an alert with a "Hello, World" message.
6. Pure CSS-in-JS: All styling is done using JavaScript, without any external CSS or JS frameworks.

Code Explanation:

Image Imports:
Three images are imported for different screen sizes: small, medium, and large.

State and Effect Hooks:
State and effect hooks are used to manage and update the current image based on screen size.

Function to Handle Button Click:
A simple function that triggers an alert when the button is clicked.

Function to Determine Image Based on Screen Width:
This function selects an image based on the current screen width.

State and Effect to Update Image on Resize:
The component uses state to store the current image and an effect to update the image when the window is resized.

Styling:
All styles are defined using a JavaScript object to ensure no external CSS frameworks are used.

JSX Structure:
The component structure consists of a header, a main area with the background image, overlay, text container (title and button), and a footer.

Decisions and Considerations:
1. Responsive Design: Using window resizing events to dynamically update the displayed image ensures the component is responsive and performs well on different devices.
2. Image Optimization: Different image sizes are used for different screen widths to optimize loading times and performance.
3. Accessibility: Alt text is provided for images to improve accessibility.
4. Maintainability: All styles are encapsulated within the component, making it easier to manage and update without affecting other parts of a larger project.
5. Scalability: The approach taken allows for easy scalability, as additional features or adjustments can be made without significant refactoring.

Conclusion:
This component demonstrates a strong understanding of React, responsive design principles, and modern JavaScript capabilities. It showcases the ability to build performant, maintainable, and scalable frontend components without relying on external frameworks.
